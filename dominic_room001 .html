            <p>
                You find yourself running along the river with nothing around you.<br>
                You look ahead and see only two options.<br>
                One option is to continue your current path (Option 1).<br>
                The other is a dark a gloomy path with limited visibility (Option 2).

                Option 1 Continue your current path
                As you continue, you can hear the gushing of water.<br>
                Before you know it,<br>
                you tumble off a cliff which is a tall waterfall with jagged rocks at the bottom.<br>
                Unfortunately, you plunge to your death (You die).<br>
                
                Option 2 The dark gloomy path
                The road is barely visible,<br>
                and everything is black.<br>
                As you continue,<br>
                 you can make out something in the bushes.<br>
                  It appears to be a torch. You pick up the torch praying that it still works.<br>
                   To your luck,<br>
                    the torch turns on illuminating the path ahead.<br>
                     Eventually you see some light in the distance.<br>
                      After all the walking,<br>
                       you are very thirsty and need something to drink.<br>
                        Two more paths are presented.<br>
                         One is a climb down a steep hill (Option 3),<br>
                          the other looks like a rocky outcrop (Option 4).
